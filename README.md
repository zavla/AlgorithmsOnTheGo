# "Algorithms on the Go" is a collection of basic algorithms and solutions to some problems written in Golang. #

Tests are included for every algorithm.

* [sort insertion](sort_insertion.go)
* [sort selection](sort_selection.go)
* [sort merge](sort_merge.go)
* [sort quicksort](sort_quick.go)
* [sort shell](sort_shell.go)
* [sort digital](sort_porazrad.go)
* [problem of selection of maximum number of events that fit the concert hall scheduel](zayavki_KKZ.go)
* [queue on the ring array](queue_ringarray.go)
* [sackbag problem by brute force](perebor.go)
* [sackback problem by dynamic programming](sackbag.go)
* [LCS, largest common subsequence](LCS.go)
* [LIS, largest increasing subsequence](LIS.go)
* [KMP, substring search by Knuth-Morris-Pratt](KMP.go)
* [problem of finding the number of permutations of boxes of two types in the stack with some restrictions on box's sequence](boxes222.go)
* [shortest path in the graph, Lee algorithm, or 'wave' algorithm](graph_volnovoy_poisk_kratch_puti.go)
* [shortest path in the graph, Deijkstra algorithm](graph_deikstra.go)
* [shortest path in graph, Floyd algorithm](graph_floyd.go)
